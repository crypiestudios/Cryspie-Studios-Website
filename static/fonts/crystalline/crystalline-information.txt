Crystalline:

Beatrice Warde once wrote that typography should be like a crystal goblet, to only convey the information without pushing itself to the foreground. While I can agree and disagree with her, I still chose her line for my specimen that accompanies this font. Since, well, what IF type was a crystal goblet instead of a metaphor?

More experiments with crystal based type will follow after this, but this is the first test: A font based on hand-drawn crystal shapes, the crystalline.

Includes both an outline and negative version of the font.
